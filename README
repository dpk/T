This is the T programming language. I did not
create this, but I felt it should be on GitHub
somewhere. It doesn't run on modern computers.

I've uploaded the complete archive, containing
the manuals, platform-specific fixes, etc., to
<http://dpk.org.uk/bucket/t3.1.tar.bz2>.

There was at one point a project to revive T,
and to at least make it run on PowerPCs. You
can access that on the Web Archive at
<http://dpk.org.uk/16>.

Olin Shivers' History of T is available at 
<http://www.paulgraham.com/thist.html>
and Jonathan Rees created a homepage for the
language at
<http://mumble.net/~jar/tproject/>.
Note that Messrs Shivers and Rees were both
involved in the design and implementation of
the language.
